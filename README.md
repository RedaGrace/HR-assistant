## HR Assistant API: Predicting Employee Turnover
Welcome to the HR Assistant API repository, where predictive analytics meets human resources management. Our API serves as a powerful tool for HR professionals, leveraging machine learning to predict the likelihood of employee turnover. By analyzing input data about an employee, our model provides insights that assist HR departments in making informed decisions to retain their valuable talent.

## How It Works
The HR Assistant API employs a sophisticated machine learning model trained on a dataset encompassing various employee attributes and historical turnover information. When provided with current employee data, the API processes this through the model to predict the probability of an employee leaving the company. The output is a score indicating the risk level of turnover, enabling HR to proactively address potential issues before they lead to resignation.

## Features:
* Predictive probability: Generate a turnover risk probability for each employee based on their data.
* Data Insights: Understand the key factors influencing employee retention.
* Easy Integration: Seamlessly integrate with existing HR systems via our API.
* Real-Time Analysis: Obtain immediate predictions to act on retention strategies swiftly.
